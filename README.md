# Phenocam
Goals, progresses, and issues on phenocam leaf phenology analysis. 

### Goals
- One goal is to overlap and fuse the leaf phenology trajectory from mulitple sources of data. Especially, to overlap leaf cover time series from BCI drone data (https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/11/13/1534) with phenocam-driven vegetation index time series.  
- The other goal is to gather phenocam data from all tropical region, to study interannual varibility of leaf productivity in a vegetation demography context. 

### Current Issues

Jul 5 2019
  - tower shadow lies on the trees in the morning earlier than 10am, but photos early in the morning appears to be in crisper quality.
  -  Download early morning images and compare (6am -8am)
  - Photos after 16:00 gets direct sunlight. Retrieve photos before 16:00.
  
 ### To do
 Jul 5 2019
 - BCI2 - Inactive, however the best image qualities. Therefore download the data. Actually, use all three camera data.
 Jul 6 2019
 - Check other Phenocam data, e.g. Lopes 2016, Leaf flush drives dry season green-up of the Central Amazon. (Cannot find this data from phenocam network.)
