# Phenocam
Goals, progress, and issues on phenocam leaf phenology analysis. 

### Goals
The goal is to overlap and fuse the leaf phenology trajectory from mulitple sources of data. Especially, to overlap leaf cover time series from BCI drone data (https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/11/13/1534) with phenocam-driven vegetation index time series.
